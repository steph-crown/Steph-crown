## Hey, It's Stephen.

I'm a software engineer with over 5 years of experience. I love building cool and useful digital products. I'm a problem-solver and enjoy finding clever and simple ways to make things work well for users. I can work on all parts of a software project, from the user interface to the inner workings. My goal is to create well-built systems that people love to use. I'm always learning new things, and I'm especially interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things.

I write articles, text-based courses, and build software applications.
